# CSharp-Division-Tutor
You will write a C# program that acts as a math tutor for simple division problems. Your program will generate simple division math problems (where the dividend, divisor, and quotient are all integers – i.e. for [a / b = c], a, b, c will all be whole numbers) – the numbers will be selected “randomly”. The program will allow the user to enter answers for each problem until they get the answer correct – then a new problem will be automatically generated and displayed. The program will indicate to the user whether or not their answer is correct.
